# WaveFun - C#

Years ago I wrote the following article:
https://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/articles/Generating-Sound-Waves-with-C-Wave-Oscillators

I lost all of the source code for it - I think - but this probably contains something very similar. 

It's built for Windows Phone 7. Between WP7 and Zune I have enough dead content to raise a zombie army. Accordingly, perhaps just look at the code and see if you can incorporate it into your own projects. 

I truly hope this is useful. If I ever find the "real" source, I will upload it here too.
